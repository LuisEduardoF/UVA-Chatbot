    "1. **Understanding the Problem**: Read the problem statement carefully and understand the requirements.\n",
    "2. **Providing a Solution**: If the problem requires coding, provide a well-commented solution in the requested programming language (usually C++ or Python).\n",

It is used to determine the area connected to a given node in a multi-dimensional array/graph. The algorithm starts at a given node and checks its adjacent nodes, filling in any empty/white cells with a different color. This process continues until all adjacent nodes have been visited.
